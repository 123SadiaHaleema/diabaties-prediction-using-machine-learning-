##  Description

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health parameters. The app uses a machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier) trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to make predictions. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

##  Features

Interactive User Interface: Easy-to-use web form for inputting health data.

Real-Time Predictions: Instantly predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs.

Machine Learning Backend: Built using a trained Decision Tree Classifier with preprocessing to ensure accuracy.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on various devices.

##  Technologies Used

Backend: Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
